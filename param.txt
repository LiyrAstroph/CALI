# parameter file
# lines beginning with '#' are regarded as comments and are neglected
# 
# if want to turn off some configurations, put '#' in the begining of the lines.

#====================================================
# file names for continuum data/line data.
# line data is optional. if no line data, comment the line.
# note: 1) line data must have the same dataset codes as the continuum.
#       2) numbers of points of continuum and line for the same dateset can be different
#       3) data files are formated 

FileCont      ngc5548_cont.txt
FileLine      ngc5548_line.txt

#====================================================
# total steps and builtin steps for MCMC sampling.
# this is optional.
# if not turned on, the code uses the default values.

NBuiltin      100000

#====================================================
# prior range for scaling and shifting parameters.
# this is optional.
# if not turned on, the code uses the default priors. 

#ScaleRangeLow  0.5    
#ScaleRangeUp   1.5

#ShiftRangeLow  -1.0
#ShiftRangeUp   1.0
